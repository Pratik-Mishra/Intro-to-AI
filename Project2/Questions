1 and 2

While searching and you failed to find Cell A These equations are the probabilities as followed:
    Let type_of_cell_A = P(target not found in cell A | target in cell A)
    
For cell A: new_belief_in_A = (type_of_cell_A * old_belief_in_A) / (type_of_cell_A * old_belief_in_A + 1 - old_belief_in_A


For cell B (or any other cells): scale_factor = 1 / (type_of_cell_A * old_believe_in_A + 1 - old_believe_in_A)

new_belief_in_B = old_belief_in_B * scale_factor
